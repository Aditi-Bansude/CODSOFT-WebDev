                    Hi there! I'm Aditi, currently diving into the world of engineering as a passionate student. When I'm not immersed in equations and designs, you'll find me exploring new technologies, debating the latest innovations, or catching up with my friend Vahini over a cup of coffee. I thrive on challenges that push the boundaries of what's possible and love brainstorming creative solutions to real-world problems. Let's connect and share our journeys in this ever-evolvingÂ field!

            <h3>Project 1 - Fire Alarm</h3>
            <p>
                Simple fire alarm system that detects smoke using sensors. When smoke is detected, it triggers an audible alarm to alert occupants and prompt immediate action to prevent fire-related incidents. This project aims to enhance safety in residential and commercial settings by providing early warning signals in the event of a fire.

            <h3>Project 2 - Turbidity Sensing Circuit</h3>
            <p>
                A turbidity detecting circuit uses a light source, such as an LED, to shine light through water. A sensor then measures how much light passes through. This tells us how clear or cloudy the water is. The circuit can show this information on a display or trigger alerts if the water quality changes. It's a simple but effective way to monitor water clarity and quality.

            <h3>Project 3 - Automatic Rain Sensing Car Wipers</h3>
            <p>
                An automatic rain-sensing car wiper system uses sensors to detect rain on the windshield. These sensors send signals to the wiper control module, which automatically adjusts the wiper speed based on the intensity of rainfall. This technology ensures that the wipers operate effectively without requiring manual adjustments, enhancing driver safety and convenience during rainy conditions.
